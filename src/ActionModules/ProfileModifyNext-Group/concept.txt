1. Data source: Group Rooming list or Group in house
 - room numbers & how many room numbers
 - db

2. read through the parsed xml room numbers as array:
 - roomNum := [501, 501, 502, 502 ...]
 - dummyName: like "zhizun" or "gzl"
 

3. fetching guests by room numbers:
 - find by roomNum.unique()
 - groupGuests := [501obj, 502obj, ...]
 3.1 need a ui for this to uncheck unwanted profiles for modifying
  - use GetNext to check focus, then "ItemCheck" event to modify (Modify(RowNumbers, "-Check"))

4. check (share === guest)?:
 - resvQty := roomNum.map(room => room = '0501').Length
 - guestQty := groupGuest.map(guest => guest.roomNum = '501').Length
 - if guestQty > resvQty, should make a share instantly to match the quantity

5. filling in:
 - main for loop: roomNum.unique()
 - secondary: for guestQty
   - search by room number & dummyName for the first loop , then room number and "1" for the rest
